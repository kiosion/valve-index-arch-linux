# Valve Index on Arch Linux
Guides & scripts for getting the Valve Index & SteamVR working on arch. 

## Manual
If you want to manually apply these fixes, or your SteamVR install isn't in the standard location, follow these guides:

- [Direct Display failing]() - if the headset displays stay blank and the image instead appears as a window in your DE
- [HMD not tracking]() - if the image appears properly on the HMD but doesn't track correctly
- [VRDashboard fails to open]() - if the SteamVR menu / IPD overlay / Steam notifications don't appear in VR
- [Games fail to launch]() - if games/apps either fail to launch, crash upon launch, or don't appear on the HMD
- [Sound not working]()
- 


## With script
Alternatively, you can use this script to try automatically fixing the most common issues I ran into. 

## Disclaimer
These fixes involve modifying files used by Steam and SteamVR. Follow these steps at your own risk, and always back up your Steam install beforehand.
