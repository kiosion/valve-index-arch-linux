# Valve Index on Arch Linux
Guides & scripts for getting the Valve Index & SteamVR working on arch. 

## Fixes
Listed below are issues I ran into while getting SteamVR set up with my Index, and have found fixes for. For each issue there's a script that fixes it, as well as a manual guide if you prefer to know what changes are being made.

- [Direct Display failing](guides/directdisplay.md) - if the headset displays stay blank and the image instead appears as a window in your DE
- [HMD not tracking]() - if the image appears properly on the HMD but doesn't track correctly, or has significant lag
- [VRDashboard fails to open](guides/vrdash.md) - if the SteamVR menu / IPD overlay / Steam notifications don't appear in VR

## Disclaimer
These fixes involve modifying files used by Steam and SteamVR. Follow these steps at your own risk, and always back up your Steam install beforehand.
