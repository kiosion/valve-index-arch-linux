## Beat Saber

#### Fixes:

- Select Proton version `5.0-10` under the game's right-click menu in Steam in order to ensure no issues with stuttering/crashing occur. I initially was using Proton Experimental but ran into constant issues with audio/video artifacting and stuttering.

#### Modding:

- Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/geefr/beatsaber-linux-goodies/releases/tag/1.2.1) for Beataroni, download the tar.gz archive and extract the contents to your Beat Saber install location
- Ensure the application is set to be excecutable, run it, select your Beat Saber version, paste in your Beat Saber install location, and select the mods you want to install
- If you run into any issues with assets/textures not being loaded after installing mods using this method, open Steam and run an integrity check of the game files. It should redownload any missing/corrupt assets, and the game will then launch and load the mods with no issues.
