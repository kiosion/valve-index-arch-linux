# Valve Index on Arch Linux
Guides & scripts for getting the Valve Index & SteamVR working on arch. 

## Fixes
Listed below are issues I ran into while getting SteamVR set up with my Index, and have found fixes for. For each issue there's a script that fixes it, as well as a manual guide if you prefer to know what changes are being made.

- [Direct Display failing](guides/directdisplay.md) - if the HMD stays blank and the image appears as a window in your DE
- [Bad Tracking](guides/badtracking.md) - if the image appears properly on the HMD but doesn't track correctly / has significant lag or stutters
- [VRDashboard fails to open](guides/vrdash.md) - if VRDashboard doesn't launch / controller menu buttons don't work / in-game Steam notifications don't appear
- [HMD connection failed](guides/restart.md) - if the HMD's indicator lights are red on startup, or SteamVR reports a fatal error on launch

## Disclaimer
These fixes involve modifying files used by Steam and SteamVR. Follow these steps at your own risk, and always back up your Steam install beforehand.
